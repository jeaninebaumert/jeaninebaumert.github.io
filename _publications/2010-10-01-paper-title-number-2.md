excerpt: 'Blockholder influence has attracted recent interest, not only in the context of corporate boards but also in the context of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  I analyze a model of project choice with dispersed information. I focus on the question whether a blockholder should delegate control to a set of delegates. I assume that agents preferences are not aligned, in the sense that delegates derive private benefits from the acceptance of the proposal while the blockholder derives benefits from the rejection of the proposal. The blockholder chooses composition of the board between delegates and direct representatives of her own interests. I find that when private interests are low, or signals are imprecise there can be multiple equilibria. The most preferred equilibrium for the blockholder is the one with minimum meaningful delegation. This equilibrium also turns out to be the second best and in particular, the equilibrium value of the firm is higher compared to full delegation. This gives rise to a blockholder premium. Furthermore, I solve the information acquisition problem of the committee in closed form.'
