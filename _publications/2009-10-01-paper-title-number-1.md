excerpt: 'This paper investigates how insiders in financial markets might profit from sharing information with their peers. I develop a three-period model based on the seminal Kyle (1985) paper on strategic insider trading, where in contrast to the previous literature, informed traders can share information about the fundamental value of the asset with their peers without disclosing it publicly to the whole market. I show that in such environment it can be ex-ante profitable for a trader to share some of its information with others. The intuition is the following: By sending information with some noise, the trader introduces noise into the economy and only he knows the precise realization of. This helps him to better interpret prices and he thus learns more about information of other traders compared to the market maker and thus makes a more profitable trade in the last period.'
