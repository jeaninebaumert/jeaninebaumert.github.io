I’m a financial economist working at the intersection of finance, information, and technology. My research studies how information and incentives shape financial markets and corporate decision-making – with a particular focus on FinTech, market microstructure, corporate finance, corporate governance, and information economics.

I hold a PhD in Economics from the European University Institute and have completed postdoctoral positions at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and at the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis at Imperial College Business School.

I am on the 2025/2026 job market.
